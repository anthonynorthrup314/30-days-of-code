# Day 2: Operators

## Details

Challenge link: [https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators)

**Objective**

In this challenge, you'll work with arithmetic operators. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

**Task**

Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.

**Note:** Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!

**Input Format**

There are ***`3`*** lines of numeric input:
The first line has a double, ***`mealCost`*** (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
The second line has an integer, ***`tipPercent`*** (the percentage of ***`mealCost`*** being added as tip).
The third line has an integer, ***`taxPercent`*** (the percentage of ***`mealCost`*** being added as tax).

**Output Format**

Print the total meal cost, where ***`totalCost`*** is the rounded integer result of the entire bill (***`mealCost`*** with added tax and tip).

**Sample Input**

```plaintext
12.00
20
8
```

**Sample Output**

```plaintext
15
```

**Explanation**

Given:

***`mealCost = 12`***, ***`tipPercent = 20`***, ***`taxPercent = 8`***

Calculations:

***`tip = 12 * (20 / 100) = 2.4`***

***`tax = 12 * (8 / 100) = 0.96`***

***`totalCost = mealCost + tip + tax = 12 + 2.4 + 0.96 = 15.36`***

***`round(totalCost) = 15`***

We round ***`totalCost`*** to the nearest dollar (integer) and then print our result, ***`15`***.
